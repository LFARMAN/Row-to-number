This is a code I made for personal use. This code only works on windows systems and has only been tested in windows 11.

The code uses the keyboard module therefore it needs the module to be instaled on the computer.

-- pip install keyboard

While num lock is on, the first row of the QUERTY keyboard will turn into the number physically above them. The special keys also works normally.

pressing 'ESC + C + L' will terminate the program

This is the first project I've made with python and also the first time I used python. I watched around 3 videos on python to learn the basic syntaxis
and then coded this in about half an hour total. I tried to use my not so great knowledge of java to guess the encapsulement syntaxis but I couldn't so I'll leave 
that for when I actually sit and study python
